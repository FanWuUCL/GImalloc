We illustrate the idea of deep parameter with an example found by our approach for \emph{dlmalloc}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{lstlisting}
1 static void* sys_alloc(mstate m,size_t nb) 
2 {
3 ...
4 if (ss == 0) //check if first time through
5 { 
6     char* base = (char*)CALL_MORECORE(0);
7 ...
8 }

\end{lstlisting}
\label{exp}
\caption{sys\_alloc function in \emph{dlmalloc}}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{exp} shows a part of the sys\_alloc function in \emph{dlmalloc}. To efficiently manage memory, \emph{dlmalloc} maintains an internal structure to organize the heap for memory reuse. Only when \emph{dlmalloc} can not find a suitable chunk of memory for a memory request, does it call $sys\_alloc()$ to extend the current heap from operating system.

After applying the mutation analysis, we found mutants generated from mutating line 6 have a notable affect on the memory consumption and the execution time of \emph{dlmalloc}. We take a close took at line 6. It calls the $CALL\_MORECORE()$ function, which takes an integer as input. $CALL\_MORECORE()$ is a system call which extends or shrink the current heap and return the new address of the heap. When the input is a positive value, it extends the heap and shrinks the heap when negative. Specially, $CALL\_MORECORE(0)$ neither extends nor shrinks the heap but simple returns the current address of heap, which is the original purpose of line 6 mentioned above.
%In line 4, the $ss == 0$ return true if $sys_alloc$ is the first time being invoked, so line 6 can only be executed once at the beginning.

Thus changing the input value for $CALL\_MORECORE()$ in line 6 allows us to control how much memory to be pre-allocated. However, although \emph{dlmalloc} provides several tuneable parameters to programmers to adjust at compilation (see Section 5 for details), none of these shallow parameters can affect the $CALL\_MORECORE()$ function directly. To exposed a deep parameter $D$ we transform line 6 into the code below, where $D$ is the deep parameter exposed for users to control the pre-allocated heap.

\begin{lstlisting}
char * base = (char*)CALL_MORECORE(0 + D);
\end{lstlisting}

The proper size of pre-allocated memory depends on the specific program using this memory allocator. If the pre-allocated memory is too large, it could be a waste of memory. On the other hand, if it's too small, soon \emph{dlmalloc} will call $CALL\_MORECORE()$ again to extend the heap, thus wasting some time. By tuning the deep parameter $D$, users can adjust the value of it to balance the time and memory consumption to fit their needs. In our mutation analysis experiments,  we found that changing the value of this deep parameter, we can reduce \#\% to \#\% of memory consumption in two of our subjects.
