\section{Deep Parameter Optimisation}

Figure \ref{system} shows the work flow of the deep parameter optimisation. The approach takes source code of a program under tuning, a set of test data and a set of non-functional properties of interests as inputs. 


It first applys mutation analysis to the program to generate a set of slight modified program. Each mutant is then executed with the set of test data.  All non-functional properties interestings are recording during the execution. All mutants are rank and 

Finnally it compbine and shadow and deep paramerter together and applys NSGAII to produce values for



Our approach takes three steps. Firstly we apply Mutation Operators to generate variants of the original \emph{dlmalloc} in order to understand which pieces of the source code could be more influential to the performance. Secondly we analyze the sensitivity of each mutated piece by evaluating the variants on a given set of applications and testsuites. After locating the most interesting and influential part of the code, we expose them to users so that they could be modified from the outside as needed. 

Thirdly, we apply SBSE approach to find the optimal values for both the existing and exposed parameters for each of the given applications.

%where if we make an modification, coudhave a great affect on the  escribe how we define a Deep Parameter and how we choose and expose these Deep Parameters.
%
%We define a Deep Parameter by starting from defining a location from which a Deep Parameter is exposed.
%
% A location $L$ is an expression that meets:
%\begin{equation}
%L: \mbox{CONSTANT} | \mbox{IDENTIFIER} | L\ binary-op\ L | unary-op\ L
%\end{equation}
%
%where the $binary-op$ can be a relational operator (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=), a logical operator (\&\&, ||, !) or an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /, \%). 
%
%So a location can be a constant, a variable or an expression derived from other location(s) with an operator. 
%
%When a location is composed of other location(s) and an operator $op$ and the $op$ is a relational operator or a logical operator, we call it a logical location, otherwise it is an arithmetic location. 
%
%
%Apparently, exposing parameters from all possible locations from a program will give users the maximum capacity to control the behaviour of the program. However, since we want to optimize these Deep Parameters as well as Shallow Parameters on a given test suite, it is impractical to expose and optimize all of possible Deep Parameters. So we firstly need to determine which locations to expose.

%In theory, we can expose parameter from each legible location and optimize the parameter on a given test suite, to understand how much better performance of the program under optimise we can achieve by tuning this parameter. Formally, $E_{LS}(L)$ is the best performance of a program after exposing and optimizing parameter $v$ from location $L$:
%\begin{equation}
%E_{LS}(L)=\max_{a} E_T(P(L)|_{v=a}),
%\end{equation}
%where $E_T()$ is a function which evaluate a program's performance on a given test suite $T$. However, it may needs infinitely large number of evaluations due to the infinite possible values of $a$. Instead, we propose a Mutation-based approach to analyse how likely we could achieve better performance by exposing one parameter than another.
%
%\subsection{Mutation analyse **}
%(** old)
%In order to obtain the sensitivity information, one simple way is to delete each statement at a time to see how important this statement is to the performance of \emph{dlmalloc}. However, when the statement deleted is consist of a very complicated expression, which variable or operator is more important than others remains unknown. 
%
%A more advanced way to obtain the sensitivity information is via Mutation Operators. Mutation Operators are used in Mutation Testing, which automatically inserts some faults to a target program via Mutation Operators to generate mutants of this program and try to detect those faults using a test suite to see whether the test suite is good enough to reveal program faults. 
%
%In this work, we just use these Mutation Operators to slightly alter \emph{dlmalloc}, in order to understand which piece of source code influences the memory consumption most. We apply both the statement deletion way and Mutation Operator way in the sensitivity analysis and compare their effectiveness, which is reported later. In either way, there are many variants of original \emph{dlmalloc} generated, all of them only differ from the original in at most one statement. We then evaluate and record the performance of these variants on the subject applications and corresponding test suites. This helps us understand the most influential pieces of code in the original \emph{dlmalloc}.
%
%(** fannew)
%Mutation Operators are originally used in Mutation Testing to automatically insert artificial faults to a program under test, generating different versions, or mutants, of the original program. These mutants are later test under a given test suite trying to discover those artificial faults as a means of revealing how good the test suite is for detecting real faults. Here we only use Mutation Operators to generate mutants that slightly differ from the original program. According to the Mutation Operators we used, the mutated location $L_m$ can be a constant, a relational operator, a logical operator, an arithmetic operator or a predicate. Then we say a location $L$ involves a mutated location $L_m$ if $L_m$ is a substring of $L$. By this definition, we can approximate $E_{LS}(L)$ by evaluating the best performance of the mutants whose mutated location $L_m$ is involved by $L$. 
%
%Notice that from the same statement, there could be multiple locations by our definition. For example, from the statement $a=b+c$, there are three locations: $L_1:b$, $L_2:c$, $L_3:b+c$. Apparently, exposing parameters from each of them will result in semantically the same program. So if we find exposing parameter from location $L_3$, there is no need to expose more parameters from the other two locations. We say a location $L_a$ covers location $L_b$ if $L_b$ is a substring of $L_a$. For example, locations $L_3$ covers both location $L_1$ and $L_2$ in the previous example.
