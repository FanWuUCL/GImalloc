\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we use Shallow Parameter Tuning to adjust a general-purpose memory allocator, \emph{dlmalloc}, to each of the given applications. In this experiment, multi-objective optimization is applied considering applications' time and memory consumption. It turns out that by Shallow Parameter Tuning, the best general-purpose memory allocator can be improved on a specific application. Beyond that, we expose more tunable parameters from the original program according to the sensitivity information derived from evaluating Mutation-Operator-generated variants. By tuning these deep parameters, we are able to find richer solutions on the Pareto front. (**sumarize other results later) By statistically analyzing the results, we believe the Deep Parameter Tuning is an effective and interesting approach that worth further investigation.
