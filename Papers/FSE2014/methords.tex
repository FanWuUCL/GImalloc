\subsection{Exposing Implicit Parameters}
%Other than the existing parameters introduced above, there might be some other valuable variables which could influence the performance of the allocator but burried and neglected in the massive source code. It could be a constant, an expression or even a predicate. In this paper we try to expose these valuable parts of \emph{dlmalloc} to users so that they can also adjust these parts to fit their needs. Other than blindly exposing random parameters, we need to know how much each piece of code could influence the behavior of \emph{dlmalloc} before we expose it. In another word, we need sensitivity analysis.

% Introduce two types of mutations and why




%For constants, exposure is no more than replacing it with a variable that can be defined externally. For expressions and predicates things get a little more compilcated. We obtained different version of an expression or a predicate from the sensitivity information and create a selection statement to include all different versions. In this way, which version of expression or predicate is used can be controled by modifying an external numerical value that controls the selection statement.
% maybe talk about rank
