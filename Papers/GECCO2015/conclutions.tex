\section{Conclusions}

In this paper we propose an automatic algorithm for discovering and
optimising deep parameters to tune programs with respect to non-functional
properties.  In particular, we focus on tuning \emph{dlmalloc}, a memory
allocator, to reduce the time and memory high-water-mark requirements of
off-the-shelf programs. Our approach combines mutation analysis to
discover sensitive deep parameters as well as an SBSE approach which 
subsequently optimises these parameters, while retaining the functionality expressed in
a test suite.  In a series of experiments involving over 70,000 lines of
code and 700 test cases we found that our deep parameter approach
outperformed baseline optimisations (which use only the programmer-provided
shallow parameters), ultimately improving execution time by 12\% 
and memory consumption by 21\% in the best cases. In addition, despite
the larger search space considered, the additional optimisation time cost
of our approach is acceptably low. Overall, we feel that deep parameter tuning 
approaches show much promise for the automated improvement of software
with respect to non-functional properties.
