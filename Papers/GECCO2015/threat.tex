\subsection{Threats to Validity}

Mutation-based sensitivity advantages in efficiency and automation, but it is not necessarily the best way to expose Deep Parameters in terms of the quality of the Deep Parameters. Intuitively, Mutation Operators may change a constant or an operator on an arithmatic expression, thus likely to change the value of the expression in different degrees so that we can capture the sensitivity of this expression. How good Mutation Operators are in capturing sensitivity information remains as an extension of this work.

Despite less possible, the experimental environment may differ among the virtual machines on the cloud. 

The choose of test suite could in some degree affect the results. Even with a good test suite that achieves a high branch coverage, it could still differ from the distribution of the real world inputs, in which case the optimized configuration over this testsuite may not achieve the best performance in real world situations. So the result is testsuite driven, meaning the best configuration over our testsuite is not necessarily a good one on every test case.

One other concern is whether the result holds on other applications. Despite subject applications from different fields for different uses, potential threat to our conclusion could exist beyond our test. Currently we can only claim that our approach works on the applications under test in this paper, but because of the wide range of where these applications come from, it is highly likely this approach can be easily generalized to other applications and lead to similar result on many of them.
