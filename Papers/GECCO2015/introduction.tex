To achieve optimal performance, many software systems need to be configured according to various workload and running environment. 
Software developers often expose a set of parameters for users to re-configure such software systems adaptively.
However, manual parameter tuning is a demanding challenge because users are usually required not only to have extensive knowledge about the system and the workload but also to balance many competing objectives, such as memory consumption and execution time.

Many work has risen to cope with the challenge of automated parameter tuning\cite{Hoffmann:2011:DKR:1961296.1950390}. Early work attempted to find optimal values with mathmatical approaches \cite{Vuduc01statisticalmodels,autotuning,Whaley:1998:ATL:509058.509096,Tapus:2002:AHT:762761.762771} while SBSE\cite{Harman:2007:CSF:1253532.1254729} has been used in more recent research \cite{hutter2009paramils,arcuri-ssbse-2011,Hoffmann:2011:DKR:1961296.1950390} of this problem. Although these approaches can automatically re-configure a system under optimisation, they only provide limited improvements because they can only tune the parameters specified and documented by system designers.


Many software systems contain undocumented internal variables and expressions which could also affect the performance of the systems.Thus, these elements could also be good candidates for automated parameter tuning. However, many of these elements are `private', which cannot be changed from changing the exposed parameters or API calls. Moreover, identifying these variables and expressions is very difficult for general users, as it requires a deep understanding of the source code of the system. 


In this paper, we propose an automatic technique to discover internal variables and expressions which cannot be accessed directly, but have great impacts on non-functional properties of interest. Our goal is to expose new parameters which can directly influence the values of these internal variables and expressions. To distinguish from parameters exposed by software designer (we call Shallow Parameters), we say these post-exposed parameters Deep Parameters. As modifying shallow parameters cannot directly change the internal code elements represented by deep parameters, the deep parameters thus provide additional opportunities in automated parameter tuning.


There has been an attempt to automate the process of exposing deep parameters with Software Tuning Panel for Autonomic Control (STAC)\cite{Brake:2008:ADS:1370018.1370031}. STAC first generates a design graph for a subject under optimisation. The design graph represents data reference transition flows in the subject. It then uses the reference patterns of shallow parameters to discover deep parameters, whose reference pattern is the same as one of the shallow parameter reference patterns. 

Although STAC can discover some deep parameters effectively, it suffers from two limitations. First, STAC requires initial human effort to characterise shallow parameters. Second, STAC can only find a subset of deep parameters which have similar data transition patterns as the known shallow parameters. To overcome these limitations, we apply a mutation based sensitivity analysis to fully automated the process of locating the potential deep parameters and apply NSGA II to search for optimal values for these parameters to balance non-functional properties of interest. 

In this paper, we focused on two non-functional properties, memory consumption and execution time, which are important objectives for many applications. We illustrate the approach by re-configuring a general purpose memory allocator,\emph{dlmalloc}. We choose memory allocators as a case study, because memory allocators are critical to the memory consumption of a program and could take up to 60\% of the total execution time\cite{Zorn:1992:EMS:142181.142200}, also many research has attempted to optimize the performance of memory allocators \cite{Risco-Martin:2009:ODM:1569901.1570116,RiscoMartin2010572}. We evaluate our approach using four applications including benchmarks for \emph{Dlmalloc} and real world applications.

The paper presents evidence to suggest that the deep parameter optimisation is an effective approach to improve non-function properties for \emph{dlmalloc}. 
We report experiments that show the deep parameter optimisation competes with the shallow parameter optimisation and the default configurations. For all of our subjects, the deep parameter optimisation saves x\% of memory and reduces y\% of execution time in the best case. Moreover we also present reasons why the implicit parameters exposed by our approach are meaningful to human developers. The contributions of the paper are summarised as follow.


\begin{enumerate}

\item We introduce an automated approach to discover deep parameters. 

\item We report the results of an empirical study comparing the shallow parameter tuning approach with our approach. On \# real world applications, the results show that our approach can save x\% of memory and reduce y\% of execution time, which is better than the shallow parameter tuning. 

\item We also report a further case study on the implicity parameters found by the mutation based sensitivity analysis. The results suggest that these parameters are meaningfull to human developers and are good candidates to be promoted into explicit parameters.
