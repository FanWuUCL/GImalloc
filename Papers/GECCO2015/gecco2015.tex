%An efficient memory allocator can help operating system save memory and make program applications run faster. This paper introduces a deep parameter optimisation technique to improve two non-functional properties, memory consumption and execution time for general purpose memory allocators. The approach extracts deep and shallow parameters to  adaptively re-tuning a memory allocator for a given specific program.
%We report experiments that show the deep parameter optimisation competes with the shallow parameter optimisation and the default configurations. For \# real world subjects, the deep parameter optimisation saves x\% of memory and reduce y\% of execution time overall.  We also present reasons why the implicit parameters exposed by our approach are meaningful to human developer. Deep parameter optimisation is thus a promising way to improve non-functional property for memory allocators.
